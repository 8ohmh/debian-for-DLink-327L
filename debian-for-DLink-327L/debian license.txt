The 8ohmhs modified Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)

    Free Redistribution

    The license of a Debian component may not restrict any party from giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

    Source Code

    The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.

    Derived Works

    The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

    Integrity of The Author's Source Code

    The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software. (This is a compromise. The Debian group encourages all authors not to restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.)

    No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups

    The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

    No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

    The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor, except animal and human testing therefore it is not allowd to use it for that in medical and pharmaceutical research endeavours which do that stuff 

    Distribution of License

    The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

    License Must Not Be Specific to Debian

    The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the Debian system.

    License Must Not Contaminate Other Software

    The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be free software.

    Example Licenses

    The "GPL", "BSD", and "Artistic" licenses are examples of licenses that we consider "free".

The concept of stating our "social contract with the free software community" was suggested by Ean Schuessler. This document was drafted by Bruce Perens, refined by the other Debian developers during a month-long e-mail conference in June 1997, and then accepted as the publicly stated policy of the Debian Project.

Bruce Perens later removed the Debian-specific references from the Debian Free Software Guidelines to create "The Open Source Definition".

Other organizations may derive from and build on this document. Please give credit to the Debian project if you do.
