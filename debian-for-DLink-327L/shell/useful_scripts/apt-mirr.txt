NAME
       apt-mirror - apt sources mirroring tool

SYNOPSIS
       apt-mirror [configfile]

DESCRIPTION
       A small and efficient tool that lets you mirror a part of or the whole Debian GNU/Linux distribution or any other apt
       sources.

       Main features:
        * It uses a config similar to APT's sources.list
        * It's fully pool compliant
        * It supports multithreaded downloading
        * It supports multiple architectures at the same time
        * It can automatically remove unneeded files
        * It works well on an overloaded Internet connection
        * It never produces an inconsistent mirror including while mirroring
        * It works on all POSIX compliant systems with Perl and wget

COMMENTS
       apt-mirror uses /etc/apt/mirror.list as a configuration file.  By default it is tuned to official Debian or Ubuntu mirrors.
       Change it for your needs.

       After you setup the configuration file you may run as root:

           # su - apt-mirror -c apt-mirror

       Or uncomment the line in /etc/cron.d/apt-mirror to enable daily mirror updates.

CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES
       The mirror.list configuration supports many options, the file is well commented explaining each option.  Here are some
       sample mirror configuration lines showing the various supported ways:

       Normal: deb http://example.com/debian stable main contrib non-free

       Arch Specific: (many other architectures are supported) deb-powerpc http://example.com/debian stable main contrib non-free

       HTTP and FTP Auth or non-standard port: deb http://user:pass@example.com:8080/debian stable main contrib non-free

       HTTPS with sending Basic HTTP authentication information (plaintext username and password) for all requests: (this was
       default behaviour of Wget 1.10.2 and prior and is needed for some servers with new version of Wget) set auth_no_challenge 1
       deb https://user:pass@example.com:443/debian stable main contrib non-free

       HTTPS without checking certificate: set no_check_certificate 1 deb https://example.com:443/debian stable main contrib non-
       free

       Source Mirroring: deb-src http://example.com/debian stable main contrib non-free
